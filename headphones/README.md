# 🎧 Project: Headphones – Front-End Web Development

This project involves building a responsive landing page for a headphones brand, based on a detailed Figma design by UI/UX designer Nicolas Philippot.

## 🔍 Project Summary

The main goal is to create a fully responsive and functional webpage using only **HTML and CSS**. The design must be faithfully implemented according to the Figma specifications, with **no JavaScript** or external frameworks like Bootstrap. The layout should automatically adapt to mobile screens when the viewport width is 480px or less.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** HTML5, CSS3  
- **Fonts:** Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT (provided)  
- **Responsive Design:** Mobile breakpoint at 480px  
- **CSS Best Practices:**  
  - Use of variables  
  - Minimal, reusable, and generic selectors  
  - Avoidance of overly specific or nested selectors  

## ✅ Key Features & Milestones

1. **Header & Hero Section**
   - Developed the main navigation and hero content based on the design.
   - Applied CSS resets, variables, and a clean HTML structure.

2. **"What We Do" Section**
   - Implemented service blocks with custom icon fonts.
   - Designed for reuse and easy styling.

3. **"Our Results" Section**
   - Created CSS-only pentagon shapes to visually represent metrics.
   - Maintained fidelity to the original design without images.

4. **Contact Us Section**
   - Built a contact form with animated transitions and form validation constraints.

5. **Footer**
   - Structured and styled the footer to be consistent and fully responsive.

6. **Background Image Update**
   - Replaced a section’s background image using only HTML and CSS.

7. **Animation Enhancements**
   - Integrated subtle animations (hover, opacity, scaling) in service and results sections to improve interactivity.
